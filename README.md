# ESLint Error Test Repo

This repository purposefully has an error with ESLint for testing with Zed.

It is worth noting that the error here is a valid error, but currently Zed displays an Apple type notification mesasge over the whole screen blocking you from doing anything really.

* `npm install` in the root of the project
* open folder in Zed
* try to edit and save index.ts
* see error
